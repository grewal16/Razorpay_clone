## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
Get this powerful Razorpay clone up and running on your local machine in minutes!

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` for managing development-related tools like Tailwind CSS.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build Tailwind CSS (if needed):**
    If you make changes to the `tailwind.config.js` or directly to `main.css`, you might need to recompile. The `package.json` often includes scripts for this.
    ```bash
    # Check package.json for specific build/watch scripts, e.g.:
    npm run build
    # or to watch for changes during development:
    npm run watch
    ```

4.  **Open in Your Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser to view the project.
    ```bash
    # Example (macOS):
    open index.html
    # Or navigate to the file path in your browser:
    file:///path/to/your/Razorpay_clone/index.html
    ```
    For a live development experience with hot-reloading and better asset management, consider using a local web server like `Live Server` VS Code extension or `http-server` via npm (`npm install -g http-server && http-server .`).
