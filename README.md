1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` for managing development dependencies (e.g., Tailwind CSS processing).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Open in your browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project:
    ```bash
    open index.html # For macOS
    # or
    start index.html # For Windows
    # or navigate to the file directly
    ```
    For development with live reloading and Tailwind JIT compilation, you might need to run a local development server, typically initiated via an `npm` script defined in `package.json`. Consult `package.json` for specific scripts like `npm run dev` or `npm start`.
