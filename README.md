*   **CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS):** Leverages the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS, for rapid and consistent styling, enabling highly customizable and responsive designs.
*   **JavaScript:** (Implied by `package.json`) Likely used for interactive elements, navigation, and dynamic content manipulation to enhance the user experience.
*   **Build Tools:** `postcss.config.js`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json` indicate a modern development workflow, possibly involving npm/yarn for dependency management and PostCSS for CSS transformations.

The architecture is a **Static Single-Page Application (SPA)** focused entirely on frontend presentation. There is no explicit backend or database layer included within this repository, as its primary goal is to demonstrate the user-facing interface and its capabilities.
