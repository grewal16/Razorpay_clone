## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
Get this powerful UI clone up and running in no time!

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `package.json` for managing development dependencies, primarily for Tailwind CSS.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Build Tailwind CSS (if changes are made):**
    While `main.css` might contain pre-compiled styles, if you modify `tailwind.config.js` or directly use Tailwind classes, you'll need to recompile.
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./main.css --minify
    # For watching changes during development:
    # npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./main.css --watch
    ```
    *(Note: The exact input/output paths for Tailwind might vary depending on the project's setup, typically configured in `tailwind.config.js` or via a script in `package.json`.)*
4.  **Open in your browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
    ```bash
    open index.html # on macOS
    start index.html # on Windows
    xdg-open index.html # on Linux
    ```
    Or navigate to the file directly through your browser's file explorer.
