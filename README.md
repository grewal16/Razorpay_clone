## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this Razorpay clone up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```
3.  **Open the main page:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. All styles are integrated, and you should immediately see the live interface.
    ```bash
    # Example using a browser command (may vary by OS)
    # open index.html # For macOS
    # start index.html # For Windows
    # xdg-open index.html # For Linux
    ```

    *Note: For local development involving Tailwind CSS compilation (if modifying styles), you might need Node.js and npm installed. Run `npm install` and then use `npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` if `main.css` is intended as an input to generate output CSS.*
