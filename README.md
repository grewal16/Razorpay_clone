## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
Get this Razorpay clone up and running in no time!

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses NPM for managing Tailwind CSS.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Development Build (Optional - for Tailwind JIT/Watch):**
    If you plan to modify styles using Tailwind, you might want to run the Tailwind CLI in watch mode:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./output.css --watch
    # (Note: Based on file structure, `main.css` appears to be the primary CSS, and Tailwind might compile into `output.css` if configured that way. Verify project's actual build setup for exact commands.)
    ```

4.  **Launch the Application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    # or navigate to the file path in your browser
    ```
    Alternatively, use a simple local server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VS Code's Live Server extension) for a more robust development experience.
