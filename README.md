## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this Razorpay UI clone up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Node.js for managing build tools (like Tailwind CSS). Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build CSS (if needed):**
    Tailwind CSS typically requires a build step. You might need to run a build script or a watcher during development. Check `package.json` for specific scripts. A common command might be:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./output.css --watch
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `main.css` and `output.css` with your actual input/output files if they differ.)*
4.  **Open in browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. All assets are self-contained and ready to render!
    ```bash
    open index.html # on macOS
    start index.html # on Windows
    xdg-open index.html # on Linux
    ```
