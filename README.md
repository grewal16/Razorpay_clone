## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

Getting this Razorpay clone up and running on your local machine is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` for managing dev dependencies, primarily for Tailwind CSS compilation.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build Tailwind CSS (if needed for development):**
    If you plan to modify the CSS, you'll need to compile Tailwind.
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./output.css --watch
    ```
    *(Note: The `index.html` might link directly to `main.css` or a compiled `output.css`. Inspect `index.html` to confirm the correct CSS path. For just viewing, typically `index.html` would already point to the correct, potentially pre-compiled, CSS.)*

4.  **Open in Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    ```bash
    open index.html # On macOS
    # or
    start index.html # On Windows
    ```
    You should now see the Razorpay clone homepage!
