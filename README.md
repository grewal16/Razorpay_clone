*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI development and highly customizable designs.
*   **PostCSS:** Used in conjunction with Tailwind CSS for processing and optimizing CSS.
*   **Node.js & npm:** For managing project dependencies and running build scripts (e.g., Tailwind CSS compilation).

This architecture represents a static site, highly optimized for performance and maintainability, driven by a modern front-end build pipeline.

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this Razorpay clone up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses Node.js and npm for managing build tools (like Tailwind CSS).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Development Server (Optional, for Live Reloading):**
    If you wish to make changes and see them instantly with live reloading, you might need a local development server. While `package.json` usually contains scripts, for a static site, you can often just open the `index.html`.
    ```bash
    # Check package.json for specific scripts like 'npm start' or 'npm run dev'
    # If no such script exists, or for a quick view:
    npm run tailwind-watch # or similar script if available to watch for CSS changes
    ```

4.  **Open the Project:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
    ```bash
    open index.html # On macOS
    start index.html # On Windows
    # Or manually navigate to the file in your browser
    ```
    You should now see the Razorpay clone website!
