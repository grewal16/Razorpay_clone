## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this Razorpay clone up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses TailwindCSS, which requires a build step. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Build TailwindCSS:**
    To process the TailwindCSS directives and generate the final `main.css` file:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./main.css --minify
    # Or, if a build script is defined in package.json:
    # npm run build
    ```
    *(Note: The provided `main.css` is small, indicating it's likely an input for Tailwind. The command above assumes `main.css` serves as both input and output for simplicity. Adjust `npx tailwindcss` command if your project has a different input/output setup.)*
5.  **Open in browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    # or navigate to the file path in your browser
    ```
    You should now see the Razorpay clone live in your browser!
