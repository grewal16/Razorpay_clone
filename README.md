## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema

As a front-end UI clone, this project does not include a backend server or database schema. Its architecture is client-side rendered, focusing on static content presentation and interactive UI elements.

Here's a conceptual flow of how a user interacts with this UI clone:

```mermaid

    A["User Opens Browser"] --> B["Navigates to `index.html`"];
    B --> C["Browser Loads HTML, CSS & Assets"];
    C --> D["Razorpay-like Interface Renders"];
    D --> E{"User Interacts with UI (e.g., Clicks Buttons)"};
    E --> F["Visualizes Feature Mockups"];
    F --> D;
```

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide

Getting started with this project is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses Node.js and npm for Tailwind CSS compilation.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build/Watch Tailwind CSS:**
    To ensure Tailwind CSS is compiled and applied correctly, you'll want to run the build process. For development, a watch command is useful:
    ```bash
    # For development (watches for changes)
    npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

    # For production build
    npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./dist/output.css --minify
    ```
    *Note: The actual output file might be `main.css` itself, depending on `tailwind.config.js`. Please verify `package.json` scripts if any, or link `main.css` directly.*
4.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the live clone!
