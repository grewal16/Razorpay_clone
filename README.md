## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
Get this powerful frontend clone up and running on your local machine with these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/Razorpay_clone.git
    cd Razorpay_clone
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` for managing frontend tooling, primarily Tailwind CSS.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run Tailwind CSS Watch:**
    To ensure Tailwind CSS is actively compiling your styles, run the watch command. This will generate the necessary CSS in `build/tailwind.css` (or similar, check `tailwind.config.js`).
    ```bash
    npm run tailwind:watch
    # Or, if that script isn't explicitly defined, try:
    # npx tailwindcss -i ./main.css -o ./build/tailwind.css --watch
    ```

4.  **Open in Browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
    ```bash
    open index.html # On macOS
    # Or navigate manually through your file explorer
    ```
    You should now see the Razorpay clone website!
